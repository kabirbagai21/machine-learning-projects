# Support Vector Machines

**Objective**

 Understand support vector machines (SVMs) and use them to build a spam classifier.
 
  *Part 1:*
  
  Use support vector machines (SVMs) with various example 2D datasets to gain an intuition of how SVMs work and how to use a Gaussian kernel with SVMs
  
  *Part 2:*
  
  Training a classifier to classify whether a given email, `x`, is spam `(y=1)` or non-spam `(y=0)`. 
   
 **Data**
 
  The dataset included for this exercise is based on a a subset of the SpamAssassin Public Corpus. 
  For the purpose of this project, only the body of the email (excluding the email headers) is used. Each email is preprocessed and 
  converted into a feature vector x∈ℝ^n

**Topics Covered**

- Support Vector Machines (SVMs)
- Gaussian Kernels
- Data preprocessing
- Extracting Features from data (emails)
