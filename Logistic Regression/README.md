# Logistic Regression

**Objective:**

Implement the logistic regression algorithm and apply it to two different datasets.

*Part 1:*

Build a logistic regression model to determine probability of admission into a university based on results from two exams.

*Part 2:*

Given the test results for past microchips determine whether the new microchips should be accepted or rejected using a logistic regression model. 

**Data:**

*Part 1:* 

Historical data from previous applicants used as a training set for logistic regression. 
For each training example, we have the applicant's scores on two exams and the admissions decision.

*Part 2:*

Dataset of test results on past microchips, from which to build a logistic regression model.


**Topics Covered:**

- Data Visualization
- Feature mapping
- Logistic Cost Function and Optimized Gradient Descent
- Decision Boundaries
