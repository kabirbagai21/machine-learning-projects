# Regularized Linear Regression and Bias vs. Variance

**Objective**

Implement regularized linear regression and use it to study models with different bias-variance properties

*Part 1:*

Implement regularized linear regression to predict the amount of water flowing out of a dam using the change of water level in a reservoir.

*Part 2:*

Go through some diagnostics of debugging learning algorithms and examine the effects of bias vs. variance. 

**Data**

Dataset contains historical records on the change in the water level, x, and the amount of water flowing out of the dam, y. 

This dataset is divided into three parts:

- A training set that your model will learn on: X, y
- A cross validation set for determining the regularization parameter: Xval, yval
- A test set for evaluating performance. These are 'unseen' examples which your model did not see during training: Xtest, ytest

**Topics Covered**

- Regularized Linear Regression Cost Function/Gradient
- Bias/variance
- Polynomial Regression
